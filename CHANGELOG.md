# v1.0.7

-   This version of Ultraviolet correctly sets the `cache` option when making a request.

# v1.0.6

-   This version of Ultraviolet upgrades [@tomphttp/bare-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomphttp/bare-client). As a result, refreshing can fix errors with the Bare metadata being fetched.

# v1.0.5

-   This version of Ultraviolet fixes a minor bug with `blob:` URLs.

# v1.0.4

-   This version of Ultraviolet introduces support for passing a list of Bare servers in the `uv.config.js` file. This allows users to specify multiple servers that the service worker can choose from, improving reliability and failover.
-   Minor bug fixes (caught with ESLint) and improvements.
-   The [@tomphttp/bare-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomphttp/bare-client) package has been implemented, allowing users to use Ultraviolet with Bare server V2 and older versions of the Bare server.
-   In previous versions, the `uv.client.js` script was bundled with `uv.bundle.js`. In this version, `uv.client.js` is separate and needs to be included separately in any workflows that use it.

# v1.0.3

-   In previous versions, the `uvPath` export was the default export from the Ultraviolet module. In this version, `uvPath` is no longer the default export and needs to be imported explicitly.
-   Here is an example of how to import the library:

```js
import { uvPath } from '@titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet';
```

# v1.0.2

-   This version of Ultraviolet is built using CommonJS, which means it can be used with CommonJS-based module systems such as Node.js.
-   This version also includes a stock `sw.js` script that users can use as a starting point for their service worker.

# v1.0.1

-   In the `sw.js` script, users must now import `uv.bundle.js` and `uv.config.js` in that order. This is because `uv.config.js` relies on `uv.bundle.js`, and the paths to these files cannot be hard-coded in the `sw.js` script.
-   Minor bug fixes and improvements.
-   Users must still use the `uv.config.js` file to specify the paths to all the Ultraviolet scripts, including `uv.bundle.js` and `uv.config.js`.
-   Here an example of the changes you might make to your `sw.js` script in this Ultraviolet version:

```diff
+ importScripts('./uv/uv.bundle.js');
+ importScripts('./uv/uv.config.js');
importScripts('./uv/uv.sw.js');

const sw = new UVServiceWorker();

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => event.respondWith(sw.fetch(event)));
```

# v1.0.0

-   This is the first official release of the Ultraviolet library.
-   The `uv.bundle.js` script is built using Webpack, allowing users to easily bundle their own scripts and dependencies with Ultraviolet.
-   This project is still under active development, and future releases will include new features and improvements.
