# TitaniumLite

A simple and lightweight web-proxy site built to be easy to use and modify for everyone.

Initial Release Date: 05/11/2020.
#### Basic info

This web-app, measuring about 15 MB, is designed to be as light on server storage as possible.

# Features

#### Locally Stored and Hosted Proxy Server

This allows your site to have a proxy already equipped when you deploy it so you can quickly get to circumventing censorship!

#### Games

This site includes several games out of the box.

#### Setup Instructions:

***You need to fork this repository; Please do not just deploy it directly to Heroku.***

You want to have Cloudflare or a similar DNS provider on your domain.

Getting started:

Fork/Download this repository

Pick a hosting service; I recommend Heroku, Nodeclusters, AWS, OVH, and Servercheap for this.

Extract the files, or hook it up to your Github (depends who you choose).

Make sure it's all good and working, if so, change all the cosmetic tidbits on the site so it's ready to be used.

Move onto Node Unblocker

Node Unblocker setup:

Configure a Node Unblocker server, by following the instructions found at https://github.com/nfriedly/nodeunblocker.com

Attach the IP/CNAME of the Node Unblocker server to your site's domain, with the subdomain "node".

Done, you now have a local Node server.

***Please add your own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.***

***Please edit the example portions of this site so you have a complete mirror.***
