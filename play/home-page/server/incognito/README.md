## Games

More games can be added to Incognito by adding JSON in `gs.json` in a specific format.
```json
{
    "thumbnail": "thumbnail.jpg", 
    "location": "./gamelocation/",
    "title": "Game title"
}
```
`thumbnail` images are only located in `/src/gs/thumbnails/`

Some games that are available in Incognito's main website are not available in this repo due to sizing reasons.
These games that don't come with this repo are available in [gfiles](https://github.com/caracal-js/gfiles).
